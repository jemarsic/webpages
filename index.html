    	<!-- Answer to Number 3 -->

    <p>		Hello, my name is <strong>Jordan Marsicano</strong> and I am a Junior at <ins>NC State University</ins> working towards a degree in Aerospace ENgineering.
		I Choose this major because I have a true love for the physics and mechanics of aeronautical and space flight. 
		This field of engineering is also growing at an incredible rate and I believe it will be stable in the coming years as I look for jobs
	</p>
		<br />
	<p style="color: #0000CC; font-family:Arial; font-size:20px; text-align:right;">	
		My dream job would be to work for a major industry developer like <ins>Lockheed Martin</ins> or <ins>SpaceX</ins> as they persue new inovations in flight and technology.
		I would love the roll of a project or team leader looking to develope a new part or solve a time sensitive problem.
		<ins>Lockheed Marting</ins> would give me an incredible glimpse into the <em>secreative</em> world of weapons developement and modern warfair. 
		I would get to go to work everyday knowing I was on the leading edge of technology and developement, seeing and doing things never before done.
		My facination with the new, <em>secrative</em>, and incredible work done by both these companies is why I think working for them would be the best job in the world.
